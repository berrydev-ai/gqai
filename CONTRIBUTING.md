## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or later
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gqai.git
   cd gqai
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   go build ./...
   ```

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

### Run Tests for Specific Package
```bash
go test ./graphql
go test ./mcp
go test ./tool
go test ./cmd
```

### Run Tests with Verbose Output
```bash
go test -v ./...
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

## Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow standard Go formatting: `go fmt`
- Use `go vet` to check for common errors
- Use `golint` or `golangci-lint` for additional linting
- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add more detailed explanation in the body if needed

Example:
```
Add error handling for GraphQL execution failures

- Handle network timeouts gracefully
- Return appropriate error messages to clients
- Add tests for error scenarios
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and ensure tests pass:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

3. Update documentation if needed

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

### Pull Request Requirements

- All tests must pass
- Code must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Include a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- All new code must include unit tests
- Tests should cover both happy path and error cases
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

### Integration Tests

- Integration tests are located in `integration_test.go`
- These tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Run with: `go test -tags=integration`

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage
- Use `go test -cover` to check coverage
- Focus on testing public APIs and error conditions
