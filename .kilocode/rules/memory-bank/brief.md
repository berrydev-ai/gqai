**gqai** is a lightweight proxy that exposes GraphQL operations as
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) tools for AI like
Claude, Cursor, and ChatGPT.
Define tools using regular GraphQL queries/mutations against your GraphQL backend, and gqai automatically
generates an MCP server for you.
